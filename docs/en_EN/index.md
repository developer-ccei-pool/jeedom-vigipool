# Tutorial to use the Vigipool plugin for Jeedom

## Add equipment

After installing the Jeedom Vigipool Plugin, go to the “Plugins” menu then “Connected Objects” then “Vigipool”

Click on “Add”

Enter the name of the device you want (If you don't know the name of the device, this will not prevent the plugin from working), then click Ok

Once in the “General Settings” menu
Remember to choose a Parent Object if you want
Remember to activate the “Activate and Visible” boxes

For the Plugin to connect to your Vigipool device, you must complete the following two parameters
- “IP address of this equipment”
- “ID of this equipment”

There are several ways to do this

- Automatically

You have a “Search Vigipool products” button which will scan all the IP addresses on your network and display its results in the “Vigipool devices detected” list.

The "Fast" button is less comprehensive than the "Slow" button

You can then click on the result to automatically complete “IP address of this equipment” and “ID of this equipment”

- Manually

You can find the IP by yourself and find the ID on the Mobile Vigipool app

If you have the IP address of your device, but not the ID, you can use "Get ID from IP" after filling in the IP address of this device parameter

At the end, don't forget to click "Save"

## Resize the Plugin

Once the plugin is configured, you will be able to find it in your dashboard

There is a good chance that the default window size is too small, if this is the case a message will be displayed to warn you

To solve this problem use the pencil at the top right of the window to enlarge it

## Use the plugin

You can see
- Top right : the version of your equipment
- On the left : you can click on the gear to access certain options
- Bottom left : The connection icon is green, yellow, red or gray depending on the quality of the connection with the Vigipool device

Below, functionalities similar to the Vigipool mobile application will appear depending on the devices connected.
